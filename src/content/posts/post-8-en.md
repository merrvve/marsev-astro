Strong Civil Space for Gender Equality Project

As MARSEV, we participated in the Primary Care Violence Against Women Prevention Network meeting of the "Strengthening Health Service Mechanisms for Women Exposed to Violence Project," implemented by the Turkish Family Health and Planning Foundation as part of the "Strengthening Health Service Mechanisms for Women Exposed to Violence" project, supported by UN Women and the European Union. 🙌🏻

MARSEV has taken another important step in combating violence against women and has undertaken various tasks to raise awareness until the next meeting in December. 🙋‍♀

As MARSEV, we strive to have a stronger voice and stance against violence against women. 💜
