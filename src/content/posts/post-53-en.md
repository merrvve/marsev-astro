3rd Primary Health Care Services Congress will be held on March 22–26, 2026.

## Invitation

Dear Primary Health Care Professionals,

The Marmara Health Education and Research Foundation (MARSEV) is a non-profit organization dedicated to contributing to primary health care services, the education of primary health care professionals, and public health education.

Aiming to improve the quality of primary health care delivery, MARSEV focuses on promoting collaboration and coordination among different health professions and institutions within primary care. To achieve this goal, it works in cooperation with the Marmara University Applied Research Center (MARAHEK UYAM) and seeks to engage not only physicians and nurses/midwives, but also dietitians, psychologists, physiotherapists, dentists, pharmacists, social workers, and professionals whose work—though outside the health sector—affects public health. MARSEV also aims to collaborate with educators and researchers in these fields.

The first National Primary Health Care Services Congress (BiBaK) was held on March 7–9, 2024, with the valuable contributions of Medipol University, under the theme “Collaboration and Coordination Among Different Health Professions in Primary Care.” The second congress was organized at Marmara University Mehmet Genç Campus with the theme “Empowerment of Primary Health Care Professionals.”

We are pleased to announce that the third BiBaK, which we plan to hold annually, will take place on March 26–28, 2026, again at Marmara University Mehmet Genç Campus, under the theme “Harmonization of Primary Care with Basic Health Services.”

The main theme of the Congress will focus on Basic Health Services delivered within primary care, encompassing both preventive and diagnostic/therapeutic services. These services are provided by a vast health workforce in our country, each unit having much to learn from one another and a wealth of experience to share. To this end, our Congress will include courses, workshops, seminars, panels, oral presentation sessions, and case discussions for all primary health care professionals. International experts in their fields will also deliver lectures on integrated and interprofessional primary care.

We believe that sharing these experiences and fostering a collaborative learning environment will make a significant contribution to the harmonization of primary care with basic health services. We warmly invite all primary health care professionals and health students to participate and contribute to this scientific gathering.

With the hope that BiBaK will continue to be a congress for all of us, we look forward to meeting you at BiBaK26.

With our best regards,

**Congress Presidents**
